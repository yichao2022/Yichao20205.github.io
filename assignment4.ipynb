        "\n",
        "Wordfish is identified as a Poisson scaling model for one-dimensional document positioning, detailed in Slapin and Proksch (2008), available at [American Journal of Political Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00338.x). It is an unsupervised method, meaning it doesn't require pre-labeled data, and uses word frequencies to estimate positions, assuming a Poisson distribution. This is particularly useful in political science for measuring ideological stances, such as placing political speeches on a left-right spectrum based on word usage.\n",

        "Scaling methods, in general, reduce text data dimensionality for comparison, with Wordfish being specific to text, while others like PCA or t-SNE are more general."
